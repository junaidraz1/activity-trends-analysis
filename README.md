# **Time Use Analysis: Statistical Exploration of Living Habits**  

This project explores the daily activity patterns of individuals and households, applying statistical data analysis techniques to uncover insights into time allocation. The analysis investigates group similarities, differences in activities based on living environments and weekdays vs. weekends, and associations between various activities.  

## **Key Objectives:**  
âœ” Characterizing individuals based on their activity patterns  
âœ” Estimating average time spent on different activities  
âœ” Identifying differences in time use across living environments  
âœ” Comparing activity patterns on working days vs. weekends  
âœ” Finding correlations between different activities  

## **Technologies & Methods:**  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels)  
- **Statistical Methods:** Descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, correlation analysis  
- **Data Processing:** Cleaning, transformation, and visualization  
- **Clustering & Segmentation:** Identifying groups with similar activity profiles  

## **Motivation & Outcome:**  
Understanding how people spend their time can provide valuable insights into lifestyle trends, productivity, and well-being. This project serves as a foundation for further research in behavioral analytics and data-driven decision-making.
